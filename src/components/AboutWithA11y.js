          Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not
          gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a

          greatness. *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal
          bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! Father Christmas. Santa Claus.

          me the Rotmeister. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. Did I mention
          we have comfy chairs?
